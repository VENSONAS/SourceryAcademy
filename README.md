This project is a simple Book Management API built with Spring Boot, designed to handle CRUD operations on books. It allows users to add, retrieve, update, and delete books, as well as filter them by title, author, year, and rating. The application uses an H2 in-memory database, and all operations are performed via RESTful endpoints. It was developed as part of a Sourcery Academy assignment.
